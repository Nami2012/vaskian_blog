Out of the countless technical workshops and hands on session flowing into my messenger, this one seemed odd.Learning about how communities function in various colleges across Kerala and getting a chance to interact with people who build up campus communities, excited me.The workshop was two days long , and I learnt a lot of things which cannot be learned through books, from the workshop.Here’s what I’ve learnt from the workshop:

**1.Entrepreneurship is not what you think.**

It’s a really exciting field for people who are not afraid of failure.Even if you fail,you learn a lot through it.

Start early, in college itself.Its that phase of your life where you don’t have much responsibilities,and you can spend enough time for it.

**2.Work hard and play smart**

We are in that era were working hard alone won’t give you results.Learn to play smart too.!

**3.Confidence is the key.**

Having confidence is much more important than looking good.If you see all those people who are leading the IEDC activities in their respective colleges or have brought a change in colleges, they all have one thing in common, confidence.

**4.Knowledge is a must.**

Be it to interact with other people or to get things done, you need to know a bit.Having the thirst for knowledge is often,an underrated trait.

**5.Power to lead comes from how strong our desire is.**

You see leaders from different colleges, think how are they capable of being one.Talk to one, and you will realize, they have a strong desire to change something or to get things done.

**6.Awareness about what is happening around in other colleges.**

ICW was an opportunity to get to know about the culture and activities going on in other colleges across Kerala.This got me thinking, ’Why is my college different from other’s given the same circumstances?’,’What is that factor that makes our culture different from their’s though located at the same place?’ ,’How can I bring up a positive change in my College?’, goes on..Also you get to realise, there are many different ways to do the same thing.

**7.Get your communication skills sharpened.(That skill can be developed always!!)**

The ability to express your ideas is more important than having a good vocabulary.

**8.Network.**

You get to know people,who become a real inspiration for us, and to whom by speaking ignites the desire in us to work more .

Moreover they gave an intro to ML, Kotlin, and a processing program , all within 3 hrs.So you’ll be getting a bit of technical knowledge as well.

One can realise all these through experience and not by mere reading.Unlike other workshops, where the subject can be self-learned, this was a place which focused on something different, and on something which needed real guidance.

It’s been over a week now,and a hell lot of information about other workshops have come up but none like this.Workshops like this needs to be experienced by more students and not limited to the 50 students present there!!
